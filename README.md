# Community Call Meeting Notes Repo 🕶️

👋 Welcome to the Community Call Meeting Notes Repo! This repo captures meeting notes from community calls (technical and business). 

# How does this work? 

Gov4git meets every Monday at 1pm PST to discuss technical work and the roadmap. We have monthly business calls dedicated to communities and enablement.
